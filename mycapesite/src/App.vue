            <h2>School Year Curriculum</h2>
                <h3>Consultations</h3>
                    <p class="info">For one semester each year, students at the sophomore level and beyond shadow physicians as they perform new patient consultations at The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke Medical Center. They learn the essentials of conducting a history and neurological examination, and very rapidly they are given primary responsibility as the first healthcare provider to see a new patient, take a history, do a neurological examination, and report to the attending physician.  
                    </p>
                <h3>Journal Club</h3>
                    <p class="info">At the monthly journal club meetings, CAPE students discuss assigned readings which address a broad span of issues in the medical field. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Role Model Dinner</h3>
                    <p class="info">The CAPE students host female medical students, housestaff, attending physicians and other healthcare providers.  They are given a real-world, rigorous exposure to the path they seek to follow.
                    </p>
                <h3>Leadership Sessions</h3>
                    <p class="info">CAPE students meet with leaders both inside and outside of Medicine to gain understanding of the skill sets necessary to develop and provide leadership in the medical, academic and community arenas.
